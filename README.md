## Swing Trading Reversal Strategy (`swing_trading_1`)

This project implements a **basic swing trading reversal strategy** using weekly and daily OHLC data for F&O stocks.

---

## Overview
The strategy identifies potential swing reversal opportunities based on **weekly lows and daily breakouts**.

We focus primarily on **F&O stocks** because:
- They are market movers with high liquidity.
- They allow both **cash and options trading**.
- Their price action is clean and reliable for technical setups.

You can easily extend this to include **equity stocks** as well.

## ðŸ§  Strategy Logic

1. **Weekly Setup Detection**
   - Fetch weekly OHLC data for all stocks.
   - Check if the **current week's low** is the **lowest among the last 7 weeks**.
   - Exclude stocks in a **long-term downtrend**.

2. **Daily Confirmation**
   - Wait for the **daily close** to move **above the previous week's high**.
   - That triggers a **buy entry** signal.

3. **Risk Management**
   - **Stop Loss (SL):** Low of that week.
   - **Target:** 2 Ã— Risk (Riskâ€“Reward ratio = 1:2).

- **Python Modules:**
  - `pandas` â€“ for data handling  
  - `numpy` â€“ for numeric operations  
  - `sqlite3` â€“ for storing swing signal data  
  - *(Optional: `nselib` for fetching live NSE data)*
